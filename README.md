# Ruby Fundamentals

This repository contains my solutions and notes while working through core Ruby programming concepts as part of the Launch School curriculum.

## About

Launch School's Ruby track focuses on building a solid foundation in programming fundamentals using Ruby as the primary language. This repository documents my progress through mastering:

- Basic Ruby syntax and semantics
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Collection manipulation (Arrays, Hashes)
- Algorithmic thinking
- Testing with Minitest
- Debugging and problem-solving techniques

## Structure

- `/exercises` - Solutions to Launch School exercises
- `/notes` - Detailed notes on Ruby concepts
- `/projects` - Small projects demonstrating mastery
- `/assessments` - Preparation for Launch School assessments

## Learning Goals

- Develop fluency in Ruby's syntax and paradigms
