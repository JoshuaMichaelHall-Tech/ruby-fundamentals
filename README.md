# Ruby Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains extended Ruby exercises, concepts, and projects beyond the Launch School curriculum. While my [launch-school-coursework](https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall/launch-school-coursework) repository contains the structured curriculum work, this repository serves as a space for deeper exploration, experimentation, and personal projects in Ruby.

## Purpose
The primary purposes of this repository are:
1. Explore Ruby concepts in greater depth than required by Launch School
2. Build personal projects showcasing Ruby skills
3. Experiment with Ruby gems and frameworks not covered in the curriculum
4. Document learning discoveries and advanced techniques
5. Prepare for technical interviews with Ruby-focused practice

## Contents

### Advanced Ruby Concepts
- Metaprogramming techniques and examples
- Ruby performance optimization patterns
- Ruby design patterns implementation
- Concurrency and parallelism in Ruby
- Ruby internals exploration

### Personal Projects
- Command-line tools and utilities
- Data processing scripts
- API wrappers and clients
- Text processing tools
- Automation scripts

### Ruby Gems Exploration
- Working with popular gems beyond the curriculum
- Creating custom gems
- Contributing to open-source Ruby projects
- Benchmarking various gem implementations

### Interview Preparation
- Data structure implementations in Ruby
- Algorithm challenges with Ruby solutions
- Object-oriented design exercises
- Ruby-specific technical interview questions and solutions

## Development Approach
All work in this repository follows these principles:
- Test-driven development with RSpec
- Comprehensive documentation with RDoc
- Adherence to Ruby style guidelines
- Performance considerations and optimizations
- Regular refactoring for code quality

## Relationship to Launch School Curriculum
This repository complements the structured Launch School curriculum by:
- Providing space for independent exploration
- Allowing deeper dives into topics of particular interest
- Supporting the development of a unique programming style
- Building a portfolio of work demonstrating mastery beyond course requirements

## Usage
Feel free to explore this repository to see examples of Ruby programming beyond the basics. The code here demonstrates advanced concepts and practical applications that build upon fundamental knowledge.
